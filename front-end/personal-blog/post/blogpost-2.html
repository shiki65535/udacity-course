                    <h1>Transmission</h1>
                    <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS and SARS.</p>
                    <p>When person-to-person spread has occurred with MERS and SARS, <u>it is thought to have happened mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.</u> Spread of SARS and MERS between people has generally occurred between close contacts.</p>
                    <p><b>It’s important to note that how easily a virus spreads person-to-person can vary.</b> Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. It’s important to know this in order to better understand the risk associated with this virus. While <em>CDC</em> considers this is a very serious public health threat, based on current information, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is considered low at this time.</p>
                    <p>There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with 2019-nCoV and investigations are ongoing. The latest situation summary updates are available on <em>CDC</em>’s web page 2019 Novel Coronavirus, Wuhan, China.</p>
