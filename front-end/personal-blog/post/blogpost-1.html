                <h1>Prevention & Treatment</h1>
                <h2>Prevention</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.</b> The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, <em>CDC</em> always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
                    <li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These are everyday habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses.
                </p>
                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <p><b>There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection.</b> People infected with 2019-nCoV should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.</p>
                <p><u>People who think they may have been exposed to 2019-nCoV should contact your healthcare provider immediately.</u></p>
                <p>See Interim Guidance for Healthcare Professionals for information on patients under investigation.</p>
