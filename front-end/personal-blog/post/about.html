                <h1>About 2019-nCoV(Wuhan pneumonia)</h1>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><em>CDC</em> is closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (named “2019-nCoV”) that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and which continues to expand. Chinese health officials have reported thousands of infections with 2019-nCoV in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in many parts of that country. Infections with 2019-nCoV, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of <a href="/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html#map">international locations</a>, including the <a href="/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html">United States</a>.</p>
                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses <b>can infect people and then spread between people such as with <a href="https://www.CDC.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html">MERS</a> and <a href="https://www.CDC.gov/sars/index.html">SARS</a>.</b></p>
                <h3>Source and Spread of the Virus</h3>
                <p>Chinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the 2019-nCoV in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a>, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (<a href="https://www.gisaid.org/">GISAID</a>) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. <em>CDC</em> posted the full genome of the 2019-nCoV virus detected in the first and second U.S. patients to GenBank.</p>
                <p>2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus, like MERS and SARs, all of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.</p>
                <p>Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, <b>suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread.</b> Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. Learn what is known about the <a href="/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html">spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.</a></p>
                <h3>Situation in U.S.</h3>
                <p>Imported cases of 2019-nCoV infection in people have been <a href="/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html">detected in the U.S.</a> No person-to-person spread has been detected with this virus at the time, and this virus is NOT currently spreading in the community in the United States.</p>
                <h2>Illness Severity</h2>
                <p>Both MERS and SARS have been known to <u>cause severe illness in people.</u> The complete clinical picture with regard to 2019-nCoV is still not fully clear. Reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying. Learn more about the <a href="/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html">symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV</a>.</p>
                <p>There are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.</p>
                <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
                <p>Outbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. <u>The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including whether and how well it spreads between people,</u> the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).</p>
                <p><b>This is a serious public health threat.</b> The fact that this virus has caused severe illness and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning, but it’s unclear how the situation in the United States will unfold at this time.</p>
                <p>The risk to individuals is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for 2019-nCoV patients and other close contacts. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV is considered low.</p>
                <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                <p>More cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. Given what has occurred previously with MERS and SARS, it’s likely that person-to-person spread will occur, including in the United States.</p>
